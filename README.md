This is a simple software used for the purpose of updating a list of favorite stories.

The program will ask you to compare two stories, in the form of the question, "Is story_one better than story_two?"

You can then enter input. Any of the following are valid forms of input:
    y (or yes) - Indicates that story_one is better than story_two and will change list if necessary
    n (or no) - Indicates that story_two is better than story_one and will change list if necessary
    u (or undo) - Will undo the previous change, if a change to the list was made
    a (or add) - Will add a new story to the list. The program will ask for the name and initial rank of the new story. The program will alert you if the story already exists.
    b (or bottom) - Will put a story on the list to the bottom. The program will ask for the name of this story. The program will alert you if the story does not exist in the list.
    l (or list) - Will list the entire list in its current state.

If any input other than the specified input above, then the program will ask if you want to quit. You can enter 'y' or 'yes' to quit, or any other input to continue.
